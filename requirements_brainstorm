Blind Opener Project

User Requirements:
•	Automatically open the blinds 40 minutes before dawn
•	Automatically close the blinds 1 hour after dusk
•	System should function after losing power
•	Any problems with the system should alert the user

System Requirements
•	The ABO shall calculate sunrise and sunset times each day
•	The ABO should connect to NTP server once per hour to update time
•	The system time should be accurate to within 10 minutes 
•	The ABO shall use an alarm library for triggering open and close events
•	The ABO shall use a stepper library for controlling direction and amount of rotation
•	If an open or close event occurs store the current position of the stepper in flash memory
•	At 0000 the ABO should calculate dusk/dawn times set the triggers accordingly
•	If the system experiences a power loss load last stepper position from flash memory
•	A watchdog shall ensure the blinds are not over rotated either direction
•	If an error occurs activate LCD backlight and display error on screen.

ICEBOX
-Encoder for manually controlling the blinds
-Current sensor for detecting fully closed/open
-RTC
-Ability to set open time remotely

IDEA STUFF

•	Output test values on screen
•	Current Day
•	Current Time
•	Sunrise Time
•	Open Time (sunset time minus 40mins)
•	Sunset Time 
•	Close time (sunset time plus 1hr)

12.5 * 360 degrees of rotations. VERY TIGHT Recommend -0.25 on either side. ~12*360 degrees 
Set sunrise and suset to 0
Use alarm to set sunrise and sunset time to 0.
	Check if SR/SS time is 0. If so calculate it.
	Set alarm for sunset and sunrise. When alarm do open/close function
Check if past 1 am and set
Get time
Use Time library:
Keep track opf


 

If encoder knob is turned start a timer
If another click detected. reset this timer.
After timer runs out do blind action (change blind to desired  
Show number in front of Blinds uI (0-100) 0 is flully open, 100 is fully closed
	Redraw blinds ui each before the number in front of it
